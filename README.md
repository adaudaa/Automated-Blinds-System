# Automated-Blinds-System

Project Overview 
 
Integrate a light sensor to detect the ambient light levels to automatically open or close blinds or curtains based on the brightness of the room Using a servo motor

# Introduction

• This project details the development of an Automated Access Control System (AACS) designed to manage window blinds access using a Particle Argon board, connected sensors, and actuators

•It will feature MQTT integration through AWS IoT Core for remote operation and a dashboard for live status updates.

• The system will include a unique 3D printed window blinds tailored for the project,enhancing both the functionality and aesthetics of access control in a specified environment

# Project Objectives

• To design an automated system capable of controlling window blinds access remotely.

• To implement a secure communication protocol using MQTT and AWS IoT Core.

• To provide a dashboard interface for real-time window blinds status and manual overrides.

• To integrate a 3D printed blinds moving mechanism.
